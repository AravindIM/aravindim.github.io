My name is Aravind I M. I'm a software developer from India. I work on projects in Rust, Golang, Python and Typescript. I'm also a GNU+Linux user and active supporter of Free Software Movement. I use Debian GNU+Linux and contribute packages to it. Most of my projects are Free Software Projects and you can find them on my [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/AravindIM) profile.
